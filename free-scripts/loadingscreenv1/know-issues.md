# Know Issues

### You changed background video and it is not showing on fivem?

FiveM’s built-in browser (Chromium) can’t play certain video formats or large video files. That’s why your new background video isn’t loading.

But don’t worry — here’s the simple fix:

#### ✅ **How to Fix It**

1. Go to [**https://www.freeconvert.com/video-compressor**](https://www.freeconvert.com/video-compressor)
2. Upload your background video
3. Change the **resolution to 720p**
4. Change the **encoder to H.264 – CPU**
5. Make sure the **final file is under 20MB**
6. Check that your video is named **background.mp4**
   * If your fxmanifest.lua uses a different name, make sure the video file name matches exactly.

After doing this, your background video should load correctly in FiveM.
